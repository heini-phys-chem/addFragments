This is a python script that adds chemical fragments (XYZ coordinates) to a target molecule (XYZ coordinates) using python and OpenBabel

hard coded for a special case and also for specific file names...

The Force filed selected as default is MMFF94. This does not have parameters for every atom and if it fails, there will be no error message (http://openbabel.org/dev-api/classOpenBabel_1_1OBForceField.shtml)
